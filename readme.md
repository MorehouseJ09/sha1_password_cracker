C++ SHA1 Password Hacker
=

This is originally an assignment that was supposed to build only on Windows XP.

I'm expanding the project to be built as unix first and am going to implement further functionality to test basic ssh cracking.

This project will be built using c++ and will require a dictionary list to try and hack passwords that are encrypted using sha1.
