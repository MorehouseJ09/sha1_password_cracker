Password Cracker Application
=

1.) We have a list of 100,000 etc words that we need to hash 
	-	create an unordered map with the proper hash -> word element
	-	we then can have a look up element -- just trying to find that particular hash

2.) For the cracker functionality
	
	-	have some particular output
	-	you can put in the hash of which word you want to see and it will input the output?
	-	will try to look up each password in the list, if it can't be found it will bruteforce the password then
